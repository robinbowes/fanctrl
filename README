I wrote this tool to set the fan speed on my NAS, based on the ASRock C2750D4I motherboard.

The information about the ipmitool format came from this forum post:

I used perl as I wanted the script to run with no dependencies on FreeNAS.

Simple usage:

fanctrl set FRNT_FAN1=100 FRNT_FAN2=100

Improvements welcome
